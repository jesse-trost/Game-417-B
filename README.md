Competitors
Similar games on the market include Portal 2 and Super Meat Boy. While Portal 2 may be in a completely different perspective and class all its own it too is a stage clearing puzzle game. This game is designed to frustrate you and make you think outside the box.
Others
Cost is estimated in the area of $245,000 to be evenly dispersed over the next 12 weeks upon
each successful milestone completion. However profits are estimated in the hundred million dollar range respectfully.

High Concept
Laboratory problem solving puzzle game
Gameplay My 2D game follows Conor and Jack as they race through their massive laboratory room by room trying to reach and stop the nuclear core that has begun to leak. One problem they are not in the same room. Second problem the alarm system has been tripped! Third problem... The leaking radiation has affected some of their science experiments! They must work together in order to survive mutated experiments gone wrong, disarm the security system and stop NUCLEAR MELTDOWNIIIII
First Minutes
Players first visual will be the company logo followed by the main game screen. From here players can choose start game, quit game, or instruction screen. After pressing start game button the player will see level 1. Right away you will notice both Conor & Jack are on the screen but they are in separate areas and can not currently reach one another. In the rooms you will see doors and pressure switches and may or may not see enemies and obstacles. It will take amazing team work from Conor and Jack in order to clear each level, and judging from the ticking timer in the middle of the screen you will need to workfast!
Game Flo
Once the player has started the game they will be looking at level 1 of the laboratory. They will notice that by using one set of keyboard controls they can move Conor and with another they can move Jack. They will need to move both players in order to successfully clear the level. Players will try to open the door to the next level and disarm the alarm before time runs out.
Victory conditions
If a player or player(s) are able to clear all levels then they will succeed in disarming the alarm! Stopping the leaking radiation!!! And safely eliminating contaminated experiments. Thus regaining control over the laboratory. This will happen in a step by step process of clearing each level.
ber of players
This is a 1â€“2 player game. A single player can control both characters one at a time or two players can work together. Players would need to be sitting next to one another and utilize the same keyboard in order to play together.
Art
The art behind the game will be two dimensional in appearance. It will appear like a laboratory with metal doors, metal background, and alarm system spikes, radioactive waste etc. Conor and jack will be 2 dimensional sprites.
Technical Aspects & AI
Player controller script for both players can be the same except for buttons that move them. Player interaction with security devices and radioactive waste (saws, spikes, ooze) Player interaction with boxes that will activate switches and open doors. Player interaction with mutated enemies (dieing and destroying them)

Graphics

HUDs
The HUD will show the player what level they are on, how many enemies remain, how much time is left before the alarm goes off, and how many player lives they have.
